# Musync

Classroom and Synchronization platform for schools and virtual orchestras anywhere!

## Setup
Clone the repo. Navigate to the API backend and install dependencies. After everything is setup, you can run the start script to begin listening on 3000.
```bash
$ git clone <repo link>
$ cd server
$ npm i
...
$ npm start
```

Once the server is running, navigate to the Vue frontend, install dependencies, and serve on the development server.
```bash
$ cd ../client
$ npm i
...
$ npm run serve
```

Now you can demo the Ludwig platform!
